# IOT-using-Thingspeak-Server
Arduino code to send the dht data into the Thingspeak Server.
In this project you will need an Arduino Uno board, Esp8266, dht sensor, Jumper wires.
For using this code you must have an account in Thingspeak.
You must set the numerical and graphical widgets in your account.
Replace the API key for your account in the code.
Replace your Wifi ID and password in the code.
After executing the code, if you open your thingspeak account and you will find your output there.
Connections for Esp8266 and Dht sensor.
DHT11 sensor (+) pin will be connected to 3.3V
DHT11 sensor (-) pin will be connected to GND pin
Output of DHT11 sensor is connected to GPIO pin of ESP8266.
